# Laravel Livewire notes
## Learning Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

Установка с выбором jetstream->livewire
laravel new project-name

Установка в существующий laravel проект
composer require livewire/livewire

Alias for Windows:

Open Powershell, and run notepad $PROFILE
Add the following line to the end of the file:
function a { php artisan @args }
Open a new Powershell terminal.
Enjoy the alias!

Создаем livewire компонент
php artisan make:livewire greeter
